# 📂 MOFA RAW Feeds

This directory contains raw output information related to Microsoft Standalone Applications and Mac/iOS App Store applications. These outputs are generated automatically using scripts, providing MacAdmins with the latest information in various formats. This setup simplifies the process of accessing and managing app-related data provided by Microsoft.

## 🛠️ Repository Overview

- **Scripts Location**: All scripts used to retrieve and process the data are located in the `/.github/actions/` directory of the repository. These scripts automate the fetching and formatting of app data from Microsoft-provided feeds. The raw data is automatically updated every 4 hours using a GitHub Action, which is triggered by workflows located in the `/.github/workflows/` directory.
  - **Purpose**: The scripts collect app metadata, convert it into multiple formats, and ensure the information remains current.
